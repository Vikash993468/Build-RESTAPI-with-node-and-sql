## API with node and sql

I Created a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database. Many developers want to map REST to CRUD directly because REST over HTTP provides GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods, which correspond to the CRUD operations of CREATE, RETRIEVE, UPDATE, and DELETE. Itâ€™s natural to want to map the REST methods directly to CRUD operations.
